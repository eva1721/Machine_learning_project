1.Introduction:

Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems and heart defects you are born with, among others. The term “heart disease” is often used interchangeably with the term “cardiovascular disease”. Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart’s muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.

Heart disease is one of the biggest causes for morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of clinical data analysis. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge. This data is not always made use to the full extent and is often underutilized. Using this huge amount of data, a disease can be detected, predicted or even cured. This makes heart disease a major concern to be dealt with. But it is difficult to identify heart disease because of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate and many other factors. Due to such constraint’s scientists have turned towards modern approaches like Data Mining and Machine Learning for predicting the disease.

Machine learning has been shown to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry. we try to concentrate on heart disease prediction. Using machine learning techniques, the heart disease can be predicted. The medical data such as Blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoked per day and so on is taken as input and then these features are modelled for prediction. This model can then be used to predict future medical data. The algorithms like K-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes, support vector machine and decision tree are used. The accuracy of the model using each of the algorithms is calculated. Then the one with a good accuracy is taken as the model for predicting the heart disease.
